Welcome to Epic Tic-Tac-Toe, a thrilling and explosive extension of the classic game we all know and love! In this exciting twist on the traditional game, you'll face off against your opponents on a board of up to 26 rows and columns, providing a challenging and dynamic gameplay experience. But that's not all - hidden throughout the board are dangerous mines that can detonate at any moment! If you attempt to claim a space with a mine, it will explode, causing you to lose your turn and rendering that space unclaimable for the rest of the game. This adds an element of danger and excitement to the game, as you must strategically navigate the board and avoid the hidden dangers while trying to outmaneuver your opponent. Get ready to experience the ultimate test of skill and strategy with Epic Tic-Tac-Toe!

Some possible future enhancements:
* Integrate with ChatGPT to allow an AI player with commentary
* Implement a new feature, Toe-nado, which randomly shuffles pieces on the board
